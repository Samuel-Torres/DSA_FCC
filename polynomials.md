10x^7 - 9x^2 + 15^5 + 9 >>> polynomial
10x^-7 - 9x^2 + 15^5 + 9 >>> is not a polynomial, cannot include negative values


A term aka coeffecient multiplied by nonnegative integer. The integer cannot be a fractional number has to be a whole number and cannot be a variable.

Terms are annotated in [] brackets below:
[10x^7] - [9x^2] + [15^5] + [9]

Degree of a polynomial is the power in which a term is being raised by. Examples:
[10x^7] degree is 7, aka a 7th  - [9x^2] degree is 2, aka a 2nd degree term + [15^5] degree is 5, aka a 5th degree term  + [9] degree is 0, a 0 degree term or constant term.

The degree of the entire polynomial is the degree of the highest term of the polynomial. Or in this case:
[10x^7] - [9x^2] + [15^5] + [9] The degree of the entire polynomail is a 7th degree term.

The leading term is the first term.
[10x^7] - [15^5] + [9x^2] + [9] would be the 10 coefficient. 

Standard form [10x^7] - [15^5] + [9x^2] + [9] is in the decreasing degree order.
